# Java-Assignment-2-VendingMachine-Logic

In this assignment, I have developed a simple simulation of a break room with two vending machines using Java. My main focus is on understanding and implementing the concepts of objects, instance variables, methods, and encapsulation. The task involves creating two classes: one for the vending machine and another for the break room interaction.

I have implemented the vending machine class in Java. This class will serve as the model, keeping track of the vending machineâ€™s state without directly interacting with the user. The vending machine will accept specific coins (loonies, toonies, quarters, nickels, and dimes), vend products if enough credit is available, and handle coin returns.

I have then created a break room class with a main method to simulate user interactions. This will act as the view, providing a text-based interface for the user to interact with the vending machines. Users can insert money, vend products, get change back, and view the status of the vending machines.

The assignment emphasizes the separation of concerns between the model and the view. The vending machine class will only handle the internal logic and state management, while the break room class will handle all user interactions and display the results. Another focus of this assignment was beggining to understand the concept of Encapsulation in Java.

This assignment was created for the Programming In Java course at Mohawk College, I achieved an 100% on this assignment.
